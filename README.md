# Gene Annotation
 The pipeline is to annotate avian genes in B10K project (Phase2)

Requirements: muscle, genewise, blast.

To run this pipeline, please refer to `sample_work.sh`. Because of the limitation of gihub, these are also GALGA.fa, TAEGU.fa, and HUMAN.fa needed to be prepared (details as `sample_work.sh`).
