1. FUNCTIONALITY

Blast or WuBlast are local alignment tools that give the user fragments of the 
target sequence that are homologous to query fragments. Their results are shown 
as HSPs, i.e., high-scoring-pairs. However, HSPs are fragmented and do not 
exhibit obvious relationships between one another. This poses difficulty for 
users to make sense of the Blast output. This program is designed to group the 
HSPs from Blast into sensible groups, so that each group of HSPs represents a 
potential target gene that is homologous to the query gene. 

Currently, this program takes as input query protein or DNA sequences and target DNA 
database, and employs Blast (or WuBlast) to blast through the given sequences, after which 
the HSPs are further processed into groups. HSP groups are ranked according to 
the score of the entire group. Such score is a measure that is internal to 
genBlastA and represents the extent of homology to the query. Users can then 
check through the ranked list of HSP groups and locate the target gene that is 
of interest.

2. INSTALLATION

Currently genBlastA has been confirmed to work on the following platforms:

- Linux-2.6-i686

For each platform, a binary file of genBlastA has been compiled and packaged with 
Blast, which can be downloaded from (~genBlastA web page~). Please use these 
binaries only on its intended platform, since different operating systems / 
processor architectures have various differences when executing the same code.

To install genBlastA, unzip the corresponding genBlastA package into a new, empty 
directory. This release includes Blast binaries so that the user can run blast 
query and group the resulted HSPs at once. 

2.1. SETTING PERMISSION

Please make sure that the permissions of all files are set to be executable. 
This can be done by using the "chmod" command on the command line:

chmod -R 'u+x' *

2.2. SETTING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

The simplest way to run genBlastA is to run it from the directory where all 
executables are located. However, if the user chooses to run genBlastA from other 
directory, (e.g. by adding the genBlastA directory to the PATH environment 
variable,) an additional GBLAST_PATH environment variable must also be set to 
point to the genBlastA directory. For example, if the genBlastA package is at 
/usr/genblasta/linux-2.6-i686, and the user wants to run genBlastA from any other 
directory, the user should set GBLAST_PATH to be /usr/genblasta/linux-2.6-i686. 
This can be done at the command line before running genBlastA command.

Commands for setting environment variables are different based on the 
operating system and the shell used. An example for setting it on C Shell in 
Unix/Linux is:

setenv GBLAST_PATH "/usr/bin/genblasta"
- Sets the environment GBLAST_PATH path to /usr/bin/genblasta directory.

For details on how to set environment variables, please refer to your Unix/Linux 
manual.

3. USAGE

3.1. REQUIRED INPUT FILES

This program is currently designed to be run from the command line. This release 
also includes Blast binaries so that the user only needs to run a single 
command. Blast is the default search program used by genBlastA. However, the user 
may also use WuBlast instead of Blast by specifying the "-P" option. See 3.2 for 
details.

The user needs to supply a query file that contains a list of 
query protein or DNA sequences, and a target file that contains the target DNA 
sequences to be blasted. All sequences should be in FASTA format.

A sample query file and target file have been included in the package:
- query: "seqList.txt" (This file can be found under the others directory)
- target: "elegans.WS170.dna.fa" (This file can be found in genomes.zip under the others directory)

Both query and target files are in plain text format (FASTA sequences), with any 
filename and/or extension. Both the query and the target file may contain 
multiple sequences. Each query sequence will be blasted against all target 
sequences. The result for all query sequences will be in the same output file, 
in the same order as their order in the query file.

To specify the query filename, use "-q" option:
-q seqList.txt

To specify the target filename, use "-t" option:
-t elegans.WS170.dna.fa


3.2. OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

There are several other optional command line parameters, which are described as 
follows:

-P	Which program is used to generate sequence alignments between query sequence 
	and the target database. It can be either "blast" or "wublast". If not speci-
	fied, it's defaulted to "blast". When using "wublast", the linux version of 
	WuBlast binaries must be present in the same directory as genBlastA.

-p	Whether input query sequences are protein sequences. It is a parameter for 
running Blast/WuBlast. The value should be "T" (for using protein sequences as query) 
or "F" (for using DNA sequences as query). If not specified, it's defaulted to 
"T".

-e	The e-value. It is a parameter for running Blast/WuBlast, if not specified, the 
default value is set at 1e-2. 

-g	Perform gapped alignment. It is also a parameter for running Blast/WuBlast. Its 
value should be "T" or "F". If not specified, it's defaulted to "T".

-f	Perform filtering. Also a parameter for Blast/WuBlast (T/F). If not specified, 
default value is "F".

-a	Weight of penalty for skipping HSPs in a HSP group. A genBlastA-specific 
parameter. Its value is between 0 and 1. If not specified, default is 0.5. This 
weight is relative to the penalty for missing gene coverage in a HSP group, with 
the sum of both weights to be 1.

-d	Maximum allowed distance between HSPs within the same HSP group. A genBlastA-
specific parameter. Its value should be a non-negative integer. If not 
specified, default is 100000.

-r	The number of ranks in genBlast output. A genBlastA-specific parameter. Its 
value should be a positive integer. If not specified, HSP groups at all ranks 
will be outputted.

-c	Minimum percentage of query gene coverage of the HSP group in the output. In 
float point format, with the value between 0 and 1, e.g. in order to restrict 
the output to HSP groups that cover at least 50% of query gene, use "-c 0.5". If 
not specified, HSP groups with all query coverage will be outputted.

-s	Minimum score of the HSP group in the output. In float point format, can be 
any real number. If not specified, HSP groups with any score will be outputted.

-o	Output filename. If not specified, the output file will have the same name 
as the query filename, except with ".gblast" extension.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of genBlast command:

(1) run genBlastA with all default settings
genblasta -q myquery -t mytarget

(2) run genBlastA with optional non-default settings:
genblasta -P wublast -q myquery -t mytarget -e 10 -g F -f T -a 0.25 -d 200000 -r 10 
-c 0.5 -s 0 -o myoutput

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the options "-r", "-c", "-s" are only used to restrict the number of 
HSP groups in the output. However, no matter how these options are specified, 
there will be at least one HSP group (the top-ranked group) in the output 
(because a genBlastA run without any output is probably never intended).


3.3. BRIEF COMMAND LINE HELP

For a brief description of all command line options, simply type the following 
command on the command line:

genblasta


/**********************************************************************/

genBlastA will produce some intermediate files during its processing, including 
three database index files that are used by Blast/WuBlast, the ".blast" or 
".wublast" result from Blast/WuBlast output, a ".report" file that is parsed 
from the Blast/WuBlast result. The final output file is the one specified by 
the user, or if not specified, the file with ".gblast" extension.
